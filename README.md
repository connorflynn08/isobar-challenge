##Isobar front end code challenge.##

As requested, I didn't go too crazy on the time allowance for this, so the makeup is pretty basic. That being said, it has functionality. 

After reading the challenge, I noted that  a lot of the work was going to be state management and working that into what is essentiually a static page. 

I used React-Select for a dropdown as it works well with functional components within react, and i've worked with it before. I also split the course data into seperate JSON files in order to make them more manageable. 

I decided to opt for a button that would open a dialogue prompting the user to log in at the bottom of the page. This button will render depending on the state that login is sent to. I didn't have enough time to work out carrying the state across multiple options. 

If I had longer to work on the project, I would probably work in Redux to work state across my components easier, and add in the other features of the project into it with that in mind.
